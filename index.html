    <center><b>RULES</b></center>
      <ul>
        <li>Mario will be holding a turtle shell which you will have to 'launch' at the flying characters at the top of the game screen.</li>
        <li>The <b>left and right arrow keys</b> will be used to control Mario, and the <b>space bar key</b> will be used to launch the turtle shell.</li>
        <li>You must first launch the turtle shell at Lakitu, who will be flying from left to right at varying speeds. If the turtle shell hits Lakitu, you will score and recieve 10 points. However, if the turtle shell is unable to hit Lakitu, you will lose 5 points. </li>
        <li>After 10 rounds, Lakitu will disappear and you will be challenged to conquer Bowser, who will be moving at a much faster speed. Every time the turtle shell hits Bowser, you will recieve 15 points and the turtle shell will become smaller, making it more challenging. However, if the shell is unable to hit Bowser, you will lose 10 points and the shell will grow larger. </li>
        <li>The goal is to score <b>300 or more points with the least number of launches.</b></li> 
    <center>Good luck, and enjoy!</center>
