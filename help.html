      <b>How to Play</b>
      <br>
      Mario will be holding a turtle shell which you will have to 'launch' at the flying characters at the top of the game screen. Use the left and right arrow keys to control Mario, and use the space bar key to launch the turtle shell as shown in the images below. First you must launch the turtle shell at Lakitu, who will be flying from left to right at varying speeds at the top of the game screen. If the turtle shell hits Lakitu, you will score and recieve 10 points. However, if the turtle shell is unable to hit Lakitu, you will lose 5 points.

      <b>Level Up!</b>
      <br>
      After 10 rounds, Lakitu will disappear and Bowser will enter, moving at a faster speed. Every time the turtle shell hits Bowser, you will recieve 15 points and the shell will become smaller. However, if the shell is unable to hit Bowser, you will lose 10 points and the shell will grow larger.
